    <h3>Skills<h3>

    <p>My skills include knowledge of Javascript, CSS and HTML.</p>

    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
         <p>I am currently enrolled in DevMountain's software engineering 16 week course where I hope to learn all the skills necessary to have a successful career in the tech field.</p>
        
    <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>Outside of the classroom my interests include staying active, playing sports and going to the gym. When I have time I also love to travel. I'm currently on the island of St. Kitts in the West Indies which has been a blast, and look forward to attending remote classes from here for the next week. </p>
